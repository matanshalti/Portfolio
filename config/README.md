# Config and Personal Scripts

This folder contains useful scripts and config files I use regularly on my Linux system.

## Files

- **bashrc**  
  Symbolic link to my `.bashrc` file â€” contains personal aliases and terminal settings.

- **fix-chrome.sh**  
  Fixes the "Chrome profile in use" issue by killing stuck processes and clearing lock files.

- **high-quality-bt.sh**  
  Automatically switches Bluetooth audio profile to high-fidelity A2DP for my Soundcore Q45 headset.

- **hourly_reminder.sh**  
  Runs a recurring terminal-based timer that reminds me to reset my focus every hour.
